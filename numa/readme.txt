The OpenVMS system services allow the programmers to get the NUMA specific
configuration and to provide NUMA hints to the system so that the resources
are allocated aligning to the NUMA locality. The C source files mentioned in
the Appendix rad_routines, rad_crmpsc, rad_creprc, and rad_qops are examples
that demonstrate how to program with OpenVMS NUMA system service interfaces.

Guide".
